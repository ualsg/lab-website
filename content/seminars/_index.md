The Urban Analytics Lab seminar series is part of our community engagement and to provide a platform leading to interesting discussions, new ideas, and spurring collaborations. 

## Upcoming seminars

### 2022-04-08 --- Using nature's contribution to people (NCP) to inform decision-making

By [Sergio Wicki](https://irl.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTY4ODA4.TGlzdC8xNzM4LC0xMzk1OTgzMDM3.html), [Planning of Landscape and Urban Systems](https://plus.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich

In many cities around the world. Nature's
Contribution to People (NCP) are under pressure.
With a growing urban population, the pressure on
NCPs in the remaining open spaces increases. The
planning of new residential areas to accommodate
urban dwellers increasingly requires the consideration of NCPs, especially when taking into
account the irreversibility of urban development. In
a compact and land-scarce city like Singapore, the
allocation of new residential areas poses a maior
challenge of high complexity.
Designed
to
operationalize and solve such complex problems,
optimization procedures can identify trade-offs
between multiple objectives by displaying the
optimal solutions in a so-called trade-off curve. A
solution is considered optimal if an objective cannot
be improved, without reducing another objectve.
Furthermore, multi-objective optimizations allow the
integration of various perspectives of stakeholders
into
the
modeling process,
making them
well-suited
to be
integrated in participatory
approaches.

### 2022-03-11 --- 3D building metrics for urban morphology

By [Anna Labetski](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/alabetski) and [Stelios Vitalis](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/svitalis), [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Delft University of Technology

The study of urban morphology is a well established field for
understanding the impact and the management of the urban form and
the built environment which is useful in many different applications. While
there have been a plethora of studies in 2D, there have been very little in
3D, of which a vast majority are not in fact true 3D and rather 2.5D. Our
work aims to project urban morphology analysis to true 3D. This work is
driven in large part due to the availability of open 3D city models as well
as new 3D Python libraries. In our presentation we will examine 3D urban
morphology metrics, the process of moving from 2D to 3D, difficulties in
working with 3D data, and applications that can benefit from this
analvsis.
