Yang Chen is a PhD candidate at Nanjing Normal University, China, with expertise in GIS, Remote Sensing, and Cartography, as well as an interdisciplinary background in geomorphology and terrain modeling.
His research focuses on urban modeling and urban morphology by leveraging multi-source geospatial data, such as street view imagery, digital elevation models, and remote sensing imagery.
Recently, Yangâ€™s work has concentrated on estimating building heights at the footprint level using machine learning methods and reconstructing the 3D typology of road networks on a large scale.
At UAL, Yang will advance his research in urban modeling and morphological analysis, contributing to the development of digital twins and promoting sustainable urban development.
