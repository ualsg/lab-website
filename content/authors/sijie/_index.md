Sijie is an urban and architectural science academic with a MSc degree in space syntax from University College London and a BArch degree in architecture from Chongqing University. Sijie's research focuses on how new computational technologies, including computer science, GIS techniques, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things, can be applied to the study of the built environment, exploring the potential relationship between the built environment and multiple social dimensions, including the real estate economy, public health, human perception and behaviour, and other social dimensions. He works on the basis of these studies to promote urban digital infrastructure construction and sustainable urban development.
