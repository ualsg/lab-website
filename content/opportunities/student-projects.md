If you are a motivated and talented undergraduate or graduate student, it is possible to conduct your thesis or capstone project with us.
Each year, we offer supervision and guidance to a few motivated students interested in pursuing projects related to GIScience, 3D city modelling, and urban analytics.

Some student projects in the past were accepted for academic conference or even published in leading journals.
Conducting such a project enables the learning of new skills (e.g. tool or programming language), mastering a new multidisciplinary topic, working on a exciting real-world problem, and the possibility of making a real impact.
In principle, most topics require at least a basic level of programming and/or data science, and managing geospatial data.

The exact topic is discussed based on the interests, learning goals, and skills of the student.
It is also possible to propose your own topic. Feel free to check out past student projects below, and please [get in touch](/#contact) if you are interested in working with us.

If you are not from NUS, please refer to the [NUS Non-graduating research student scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/non-graduating).

### Potential topics

You may [approach us](/#contact) to discuss potential topics for research.
The topics will depend on many factors, such as our [ongoing research projects]({{< relref "../project/" >}}) (in which we might be able to accommodate a student project), [latest publications]({{< relref "../publication/" >}}) (which we may want to extend), and the background/interests/study programme/learning goals of the student.
