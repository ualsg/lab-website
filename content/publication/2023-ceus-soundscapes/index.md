abstract: 'A healthy acoustic environment is an essential component of sustainable cities. Various noise monitoring and simulation techniques have been developed to measure and evaluate urban sounds. However, sensing large areas at a fine resolution remains a great challenge. Based on machine learning, we introduce a new application of street view imagery â€” estimating large-area high-resolution urban soundscapes, investigating the premise that we can predict and characterize soundscapes without laborious and expensive noise measurements. First, visual features are extracted from street-level imagery using computer vision. Second, fifteen soundscape indicators are identified and a survey is conducted to gauge them solely from images. Finally, a prediction model is constructed to infer the urban soundscape by modeling the non-linear relationship between them. The results are verified with extensive field surveys. Experiments conducted in Singapore and Shenzhen using half a million images affirm that street view imagery enables us to sense large-scale urban soundscapes with low cost but high accuracy and detail, and provides an alternative means to generate soundscape maps. R squared reaches 0.48 by evaluating the predicted results with field data collection. Further novelties in this domain are revealing the contributing visual elements and spatial laws of soundscapes, underscoring the usability of crowdsourced data, and exposing international patterns in perception.'
