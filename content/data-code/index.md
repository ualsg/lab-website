We believe in open science and reproducible research.
Besides open access [publications](/publication), we are committed to publishing our code and data on [our Github account](https://github.com/ualsg).

For the list of resources that we are happy to share with fellow scientists and practitioners, please see below (and stay tuned as we will be adding more resources in future along with new projects).

If you use the code and/or the data for presentations and publications, we kindly ask you to cite us and credit our work. 
We have provided guidelines in each resource.

While a great deal of effort has been put into each project, we cannot be held responsible for the use of data and any errors that may arise.

Feel free to contact us for more information, to report bugs and errors, or simply to inform us what are you using the data for.
We are also happy to have contributors and collaborations.
