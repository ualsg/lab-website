The principal investigator of the [NUS Urban Analytics Lab](/), Dr {{< mention "filip" >}} has been voted as co-chair of the 
[3D Information Management (3DIM) Domain Working Group](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg) at the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.ogc.org).

OGC is an international consortium of more than 500 businesses, government agencies, research organizations, and universities driven to make geospatial (location) information and services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

The 3D Information Management (3DIM) Domain Working Group is facilitating the definition and development of interface and encoding standards that enable software to develop solutions that allow infrastructure owners, builders, emergency responders, community planners, and the travelling public to better manage and navigate complex built environments.
