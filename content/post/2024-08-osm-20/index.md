[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is turning 20!

For those who are not familiar, Wikipedia [defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) it well:
> OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open geographic database updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration.

Our group and discipline have greatly benefited from this amazing project and its contributors. Over the past two decades, OpenStreetMap has been a game changer, enabling communities worldwide, supporting research and products, and spurring a vibrant research ecosystem.

Thanks to OSM, we have access to a variety of geospatial information from around the world previously not freely available, and we are especially proud that Singapore is so well mapped in the platform. 🇸🇬🗺️

While OSM data is regularly part of our projects, we have also been conducting research on its data, e.g. data quality:

> Biljecki F, Chow YS, Lee K (2023): Quality of crowdsourced geospatial building information: A global assessment of OpenStreetMap attributes. _Building and Environment_ 237: 110295. [<i class="ai ai-doi-square ai"></i> 10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110295](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110295) [<i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> PDF](/publication/2023-bae-osm-qa/2023-bae-osm-qa.pdf)</i>  <i class="ai ai-open-access-square ai"></i>

We look forward to seeing where the next 20 years will take the project!
