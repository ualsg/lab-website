### Description

The [NUS Fellows Programme (Southeast Asia)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/research/funding-opportunities/NUS-fellows-programme-southeast-asia) aims to attract bright young faculty members (or would-be faculty members) and researchers from ASEAN universities and research institutes to NUS for a 6 to 12-month fellowship.

The [NUS Urban Analytics Lab](/) is seeking a talented and highly motivated postdoctoral research fellow to join our research group through this fellowship, to work on a topic in the domain of the lab (GIScience, urban analytics, 3D city modelling).

Up to 25 Fellowships will be offered each year.
Applicants must either be citizens of an ASEAN country or must be residing in an ASEAN country at the time of application.
Female candidates are especially encouraged to apply.

For more information on all the requirements, check out the [website of the scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/research/funding-opportunities/NUS-fellows-programme-southeast-asia).

We welcome interested applicants to develop a short research proposal, which we will endorse in case there is a match.

Candidates should have a computational affinity and a PhD degree in geographical information science, computer science, geomatics, or another relevant field of study, with a successful track record (in terms of publications/impact and/or other forms of output).

The research fellow will be supervised by the principal investigator [Dr Filip Biljecki](/authors/filip/), [NUS School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

The Lab will provide a motivating, conducive, and flexible environment to explore the research fellow's interests and build skills required for future career steps.

### Venue

#### National University of Singapore

The [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) is ranked consistently as one of the world's top universities.
It aspires to be a vital community of academics, researchers, staff, students and alumni working together in a spirit of innovation and enterprise for a better world.

Singapore is a cosmopolitan English-speaking city-state bridging the East and the West.
It is considered as the [#1 most competitive country](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-economy-ranked-worlds-most-competitive) and the [safest country in the world](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/singapore-ranked-safest-country-world-above-japan-survey), [successfully attracting talents from all parts of the globe](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-retains-top-spot-in-asia-pacific-index-for-talent-competitiveness) by offering first-class living and working experience in the heart of Southeast Asia, and a very clean, efficient and low-tax environment.
And great food and weather, of course.

#### Urban Analytics Lab

The NUS Urban Analytics Lab is an interdepartmental multidisciplinary research group established in 2019 focusing on urban analytics, geographic data science, and 3D city modelling at the [NUS School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).
Our mission is to leverage on spatially enabled data for urban applications, catalyse the development of 3D geoinformation in the context of smart cities, make sense of big geospatial data and digital twins in the built environment, and cater to disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, and real estate to make informed decisions using 3D city models and urban analytics.
The group is the first one in Singapore encompassing the entire 3D GIS ecosystem under the same roof: from standardisation and generation of 3D city models all the way to their utilisation and visualisation, while continuously exploring new frontiers in the field. 

The principal investigator of the Lab was [awarded](/post/2020/07/16/filip-biljecki-appointed-as-presidential-young-professor/) the prestigious presidential young professorship in 2020, supporting the longterm development of the research group.
