The Lab is active in the following teaching activities at the National University of Singapore:

- [Teaching master courses](#graduate-courses)
- [Supervising student projects (theses and dissertations)](#theses-dissertations-and-capstone-projects)

Please see below for more information.

## Graduate courses

Our teaching activities span multiple modules offered as part of different master programmes at the [NUS School of Design and Environment](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).
The exact offering of modules will depend on the academic year.

**GIS and Cartography (Semester 1)**

- This introductory module is part of the [MSc in Real Estate](http://www.rst.nus.edu.sg/graduate/msc-programme.html). It is also recommended for [Master in Urban Planning](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-urban-planning/) and [Master of Arts in Urban Design](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-arts-in-urban-design/) students.
In this course, we teach the basics of geographical information science and give a thorough tutorial of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org), supported by assignments relevant to urban planning and real estate, but spanning also other disciplines.

**Introduction to Data Science (Semester 1)**

- A new module for Architecture students, which is designed for those who wish to start with data science and programming (in R) from scratch.
The course is of generic nature, covering a bit of several topics, but it puts urban data and data visualisation in the spotlight.

**~~Geographic Data Science and Urban Analytics (Semester 2)~~**

- ~~This module continues the above course with intermediate topics, focusing on geographic data science and urban analytics.~~ (Continuing in 2022.)


**Planning Technologies (Semester 2)**

- A new compulsory [Master in Urban Planning](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-urban-planning/) module designed to acquaint students with the state of the art of urban planning technologies, predominantly urban data science.
Depending on the AY, the course may include also lectures by external partners, e.g. [Urban Redevelopment Authority](https://www.ura.gov.sg/).


## Theses, dissertations, and capstone projects

If you are a motivated and talented undergrad or grad student, it is possible to conduct your thesis (or capstone project) research with us.
Each year, we offer guidance to a few students in pursuing projects (scroll down to see some of the offered [topics](#potential-topics)) in the domain of GIS, 3D city modelling, and urban analytics.
Some of the student projects in the past have been successful resulting in conference and journal papers, benefiting to the outreach of the research and the graduates' CVs.
Our novel topics enable students to learn new skills (e.g. tool or programming language), learn about a new multidisciplinary topic, work on a exciting real-world problem, and have the potential to have an impact.
In principle, most topics require at least a basic level of programming and/or data science, and managing geospatial data.

The list of topics below is only directional, and it is also possible to propose your own topic.

Non-NUS students (from other Singaporean and from overseas universities), please see the [NUS Non-graduating research student scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/non-graduating) if interested.

### Potential topics

We have a list of potential topics for research (please see below), or have a look at our [ongoing research projects]({{< relref "../project/" >}}) in which we might be able to accommodate a student project.
The topics are mostly general, and the candidate is expected to refine a topic further.
The topics are not carved in stone, and may be adapted to suit the student's background and interest.

Are you interested in one of the topics below? Get in [touch](/openings/#contact).
Or feel free to propose your own topic that is within the Lab's domain of research.
You can also check out our [blog](/post), we have published some analyses that could be extended into a thesis.
