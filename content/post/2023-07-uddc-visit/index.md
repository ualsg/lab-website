We were thrilled to welcome a group of exceptional young researchers led by Professor Niramon Serisakul from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, to the NUS Urban Analytics Lab.

Their visit to our research group and the state-of-the-art SDE4 facility at NUS was truly an honour and a testament to the growing importance of urban analytics and city science in Southeast Asia.

We eagerly look forward to the exciting possibilities for joint research endeavours with these talented designers and look forward to applying cutting-edge data-driven solutions to urban challenges in Southeast Asia and beyond.
Check out the amazing work of the Urban Design and Development Center at their [website](https://www.uddc.net/).
