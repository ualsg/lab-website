Sponsored by China Scholarship Council (CSC) to be an exchange master student in NUS, I am here to do research on data analysis and data visualization in real estate industry. Meanwhile, I am very interested in joining some international competitions and volunteer works. As for work experience, I used to be a data engineer intern in the supply chain of Apple and IT assistant intern in Deloitte.
