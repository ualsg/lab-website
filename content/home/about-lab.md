We are a new interdepartmental multidisciplinary research group focusing on urban data analysis, geographic data science, and 3D city modelling at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg), the #1 university in Asia and world's #11 (QS 2021). 

Our mission is to leverage on spatially enabled data for urban applications, catalyse the development of geospatial infrastructure and technology in the context of smart cities, and make sense of big geospatial data and digital twins in the built environment to achieve informed decisions.

The research group is led by Dr {{% mention "filip" %}}, presidential young professor at the [NUS School of Design and Environment](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

We are involved in several international collaborations such as the [World Economic Forum (WEF)](https://www.weforum.org), the [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)](https://www.isprs.org), and the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.opengeospatial.org).
On the national level, we have collaborations with Singapore Government agencies, other research groups, and companies.
