We are introducing innovative methods, datasets, and software to advance data-driven urban planning, digital twins, and geospatial technologies in building and managing the smart cities of tomorrow. 
Using a multidisciplinary approach, we adopt recent advancements in the domains of urban data science, geomatics, computer science, and crowdsourcing to conceive cutting-edge techniques for urban sensing and analytics.
