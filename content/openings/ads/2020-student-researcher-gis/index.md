### Job and project description

The [Urban Analytics Lab](/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) is seeking a motivated NUS student to assist with the ongoing research at the group.

The successful applicant will work on one of the projects in the domains of the Lab (3D geospatial data, urban analytics, and GIScience).
For example, spatial data quality analysis, processing spatial data, or conducting urban data analyses.

Among others, and depending on the project, the responsibilities will include collecting data, processing data, validating data, literature review, assisting in writing documentation and preparing deliverables, and attending meetings.
The student researcher will work together with the [members of the team](/people).

The start, duration, and the time frame of the involvement are negotiable.

In general, candidates are required to fulfil the following requirements:

- Being enrolled as students at the National University of Singapore in a related study programme during the duration of the involvement.
- Depending on the project: experience with programming (Python and/or R would be nice) and data science (e.g. scikit-learn).
- Preferably (but not a must) prior experience in GIS and/or data science.
- Communication and writing skills in English, and an ability to present research.

The remuneration will be commensurate with the university's range, i.e. the [NUS Student Work Scheme (NSWS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/about/join-us/nsws).

While the start and the time frame of the work are subject to mutual agreement, we expect that:

- You will be available for about 10-14 hours per week on average.
- You will be able to commit to a period of at least 3-4 months of work (i.e. length of a semester).
- During the project you will not be involved in another part-time work or internship.

### Theses / final year projects

Please note that this engagement is in principle not intended to be framed as a thesis project.
If you are interested in conducting a master thesis with us, you are welcome to contact us. 
Please have a look at the [topics we offer and examples of completed theses](/teaching/#theses-dissertations-and-capstone-projects).
You are also free to propose your own project.
Do note that master theses are rather for credits and fulfilling graduation requirements, therefore, they are not paid.

### Application

Please apply by [email](mailto:filip@nus.edu.sg) (please write "Application for the student researcher position" in the subject), including the following materials:

* CV
* Short cover (up to 0.5-1 page) briefly indicating your motivation and plans. The letter should also include the availability (preferred starting date and length).
* Optional: portfolio demonstrating relevant work and/or links to completed projects. While at this early stage of your career we do not expect that you will have rich experience, supplementary material such as a portfolio would help us to get a hint of your activities, capabilities, and interests so far.
