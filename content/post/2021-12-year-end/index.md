As we are approaching the end of the year, it is time to reflect and be grateful for all the progress we made in 2021.
As a new research group, we are happy to have consolidated our research directions and set a strong foundations for the years to come.

The list of our papers published so far is [here](/publication/), while our news items are available at our [blog](/post/).
We also released a couple of [software packages and datasets](/data-code/), that may be of interest to the wider community.
Our team has also been enriched [by new researchers who have joined us this year]({{< relref "/post/2021-08-new-researchers" >}}).

Our work has resulted also in [invited talks]({{< relref "/post/2021-03-geo-connect-asia" >}}), [awards]({{< relref "/post/2021-12-stea" >}}), [press releases]({{< relref "/media" >}}), [an editorial board appointment]({{< relref "/post/2021-11-landup-board" >}}), and [a special issue]({{< relref "/post/2021-02-tgis-special-issue" >}}).
Above all, we had lots of fun doing research together. 


A study led by Stanford University has identified top 2% scientists worldwide in a variety of fields.
The [PI](/authors/filip/) of the Lab is on the list.
For more information about the study, see the dataset ["Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators"](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/3) and their papers published in PLOS Biology indicating the motivation and methodology ([here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000384) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000918)).

We are especially happy to celebrate the achievements of our master students, mostly based on their [graduation projects]({{< relref "/post/2021-09-graduation-projects-2021" >}}).
Four papers first-authored or co-authored by master students have been published in leading journals this year, such as [Computers, Environment and Urban Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems):

The National University of Singapore continued performing very well in rankings, with QS [considering](https://news.nus.edu.sg/nus-ranked-top-10-globally-in-16-subjects/) it among the world's best universities and [our department among the top 10 in the world]({{< relref "/post/2021-03-qs-ranking" >}}).

2021 is also the last year of our NUS School of Design and Environment, which has played an important role in developing Singapore's built environment research and education over the past five decades.
As of 1 January 2022, it will be merged with the NUS Faculty of Engineering, starting a new exciting chapter: the [NUS College of Design and Engineering](https://cde.nus.edu.sg).
Read more about this fusion in the [press release by NUS](https://news.nus.edu.sg/two-new-colleges-at-nus-to-deliver-flexible-interdisciplinary-education-more-accessibly-and-at-greater-scale/).

We wish everyone a new year filled with success, happiness, and prosperity!
