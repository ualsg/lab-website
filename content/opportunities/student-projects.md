If you are a motivated and talented undergraduate or graduate student, it is possible to conduct your thesis (or capstone project) research with us.
Each year, we offer supervision and guidance to a few motivated students in pursuing projects in the domain of GIScience, 3D city modelling, and urban analytics.

Some of the student projects in the past have been successful resulting in conference and leading journal papers, benefiting the outreach of the research and the graduates' CVs.
Conducting such a project facilitates learning new skills (e.g. tool or programming language), mastering a new multidisciplinary topic, working on a exciting real-world problem, and having the potential to have an impact.
In principle, most topics require at least a basic level of programming and/or data science, and managing geospatial data.

The exact topic is discussed based on the interests, learning goals, and skills of the student.
It is also possible to propose your own topic.
Get in [touch](/#contact) if interested.

Non-NUS students (from other Singaporean and from overseas universities), please see the [NUS Non-graduating research student scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/non-graduating) if interested.

### Potential topics

You may [approach us](/#contact) to discuss potential topics for research.
The topics will depend on many factors, such as our [ongoing research projects]({{< relref "../project/" >}}) (in which we might be able to accommodate a student project), [latest publications]({{< relref "../publication/" >}}) (which we may want to extend), and the background/interests/study programme/learning goals of the student.
