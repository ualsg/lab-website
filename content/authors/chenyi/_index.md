Dr Chenyi Cai is a computational designer and architect. Her research interests lie in the interface of computation, AI, and urban design. Her research focuses on interdisciplinary methodologies through computational design to leverage the interactions between machines and human intelligence and boost the understanding of city complexity and creativity in design.  In this context, she had experience in digital fabrication and generative design. Her Ph.D. research investigates urban computational modeling and digital design methods based on multi-source data streams.

She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Semantic Urban Elements (SUE) team, the Future Cities Laboratory Global programme of the Singapore-ETH Centre. In this role, she contributes to the formal definitions of urban design variables, aims, and outcomes in the context of digital design approaches. Previously, she was a visiting Ph.D. at the Institute of Technology in Architecture, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. She completed her Ph.D. at the Institute of Architectural Algorithms & Applications, Southeast University (China).
