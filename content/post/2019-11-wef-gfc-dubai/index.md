The [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org)’s [Global Future Councils](https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-future-councils) are the world’s foremost interdisciplinary knowledge network dedicated to promoting innovative thinking to shape a sustainable and inclusive future for all.
The network convenes more than 700 of the most relevant and knowledgeable thought leaders from academia, government, business and civil society, grouped in expertise-based, thematic councils. It is an invitation-only community, and members are nominated for a one-year period.

In this mandate the council will explore strategies to achieve low carbon cities. 
We are particularly interested in discovering how can 3D city models help us achieving that goal.
