Dr {{% mention "filip" %}}, the principal investigator of our research group, joins the Editorial Board of [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/), a top journal that is part of the [Nature Portfolio](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio).
[It is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal for descriptions of datasets, and research that advances the sharing and reuse of scientific data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/journal-information).


Our Lab is committed to open science, and [often releases data and software outputs openly](/data-code/).

We have a couple of new exciting open datasets and open-source software packages coming out soon, stay tuned for the announcements!
