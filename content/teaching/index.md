The Lab is active in the following teaching activities at the National University of Singapore:

- [Teaching master courses](#graduate-courses)
- [Supervising student projects (theses and dissertations)](#theses-dissertations-and-capstone-projects)

Please see below for more information.

## Graduate courses

Our teaching activities span multiple modules offered as part of different master programmes at the [NUS School of Design and Environment](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).
The exact offering of modules will depend on the academic year.

**GIS and Cartography (Semester 1)**

- This introductory module is part of the [MSc in Real Estate](http://www.rst.nus.edu.sg/graduate/msc-programme.html). It is also recommended for [Master of Urban Planning](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-urban-planning/) and [Master of Arts in Urban Design](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-arts-in-urban-design/) students.
In this course, we teach the basics of geographical information science and give a thorough tutorial of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org), supported by assignments relevant to urban planning and real estate, but spanning also other disciplines.

**Planning Technologies (Semester 2)**

- A new core [Master of Urban Planning](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-urban-planning/) module designed to acquaint students with the state of the art of urban planning technologies, predominantly urban data science.
Depending on the AY, the course may include also guest lectures by external partners, e.g. [Urban Redevelopment Authority](https://www.ura.gov.sg/).
To get an peek in the topics and content, an example of a group project by previous students is featured in [this blog post]({{< relref "/post/2021-05-recovery-patterns" >}}).

**Introduction to Data Science (Semester 2)**

- A new module for Architecture students, which is designed for those who wish to start with data science and programming from scratch.
The course is of generic nature, covering a bit of several topics, but it puts urban data and data visualisation in the spotlight.

## Theses, dissertations, and capstone projects

If you are a motivated and talented undergraduate or graduate student, it is possible to conduct your thesis (or capstone project) research with us.
Each year, we offer supervision and guidance to a few motivated students in pursuing projects in the domain of GIScience, 3D city modelling, and urban analytics.

Some of the student projects in the past have been successful resulting in conference and journal papers, benefiting the outreach of the research and the graduates' CVs.
Conducting such a project facilitates learning new skills (e.g. tool or programming language), mastering a new multidisciplinary topic, working on a exciting real-world problem, and having the potential to have an impact.
In principle, most topics require at least a basic level of programming and/or data science, and managing geospatial data.

The exact topic is discussed based on the interests, learning goals, and skills of the student.
It is also possible to propose your own topic.
Get in [touch](/#contact) if interested.

Non-NUS students (from other Singaporean and from overseas universities), please see the [NUS Non-graduating research student scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/non-graduating) if interested.

### Potential topics

You may [approach us](/#contact) to discuss potential topics for research.
The topics will depend on many factors, such as our [ongoing research projects]({{< relref "../project/" >}}) (in which we might be able to accommodate a student project), [latest publications]({{< relref "../publication/" >}}) (which we may want to extend), and the background/interests/study programme/learning goals of the student.
