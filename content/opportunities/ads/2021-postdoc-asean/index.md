### Description

The [SG Academies ASEAN Fellowship Programme](https://snas.org.sg/aseanfellowship) aims to attract bright postgraduate researchers from ASEAN countries to Singapore research institutions for a 2-year long fellowship. The programme, first started in 2020, is administered by three academies in Singapore - the Singapore National Academy of Science (SNAS), together with the Academy of Medicine Singapore (AMS), and the Academy of Engineering Singapore (AES) - and funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF). It involves the participating host institutions, including Singapore universities and research institutions such as A*STAR, and candidates aligning to agreed fields of research (science, medicine, engineering, and computer science). 

The [NUS Urban Analytics Lab](/) is seeking a talented and motivated postdoctoral research fellow to join our research group through this fellowship, to work on a topic in the domain of the Lab.

For more information on all the requirements, check out the [website of the scheme](https://snas.org.sg/aseanfellowship).

We welcome interested applicants to develop a short research proposal, which we will endorse in case there is a match.

Candidates should have a computational affinity and a PhD degree in geographical information science, computer science, geomatics, or another relevant field of study, preferably with a successful track record (in terms of publications/impact and/or other forms of output).

The research fellow will be supervised by the principal investigator [Dr Filip Biljecki](/authors/filip/), [NUS School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

The Lab will provide a motivating, conducive, and flexible environment to explore the research fellow's interests and build skills required for future career steps.

*Our research group aims to increase the share of women in research.
Female candidates are therefore encouraged to apply.*

### Venue

#### National University of Singapore

The [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) is ranked consistently as one of the world's top universities.
It aspires to be a vital community of academics, researchers, staff, students and alumni working together in a spirit of innovation and enterprise for a better world.

Singapore is a cosmopolitan English-speaking city-state bridging the East and the West.
It is considered as the [#1 most competitive country](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-economy-ranked-worlds-most-competitive), the [best place to be during the ongoing pandemic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56939261.amp), and the [safest country in the world](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/singapore-ranked-safest-country-world-above-japan-survey). Singapore offers world-class living standards and a very clean, efficient, and low-tax environment which has [successfully attracted talents from all over the world](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-retains-top-spot-in-asia-pacific-index-for-talent-competitiveness).
And of course, it has great food and weather.

#### Urban Analytics Lab

The NUS Urban Analytics Lab is an interdepartmental multidisciplinary research group established in 2019 focusing on urban analytics, geographic data science, and 3D city modelling at the [NUS School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).
Our mission is to leverage on spatially enabled data for urban applications, catalyse the development of 3D geoinformation in the context of smart cities, make sense of big geospatial data and digital twins in the built environment, and cater to disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, and real estate to make informed decisions using 3D city models and urban analytics.
The group is the first one in Singapore encompassing the entire 3D GIS ecosystem under the same roof: from standardisation and generation of 3D city models all the way to their utilisation and visualisation, while continuously exploring new frontiers in the field. 

Our Lab is located at SDE4, [the first newly-built net-zero energy building in Singapore]({{< ref "/post/2020-12-sde4-ilfi/index.md" >}}), and the first university building in the world to be [WELL Certified Gold](https://www.wellcertified.com/).

The principal investigator of the Lab was [awarded](/post/2020/07/16/filip-biljecki-appointed-as-presidential-young-professor/) the prestigious presidential young professorship in 2020, supporting the longterm development of the research group.
