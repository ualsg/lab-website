We are a multidisciplinary research group focusing on urban data analysis, geographic data science, and 3D city modelling at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg), a leading global university centred in Asia.

Our mission is to leverage spatially enabled data for urban applications, catalyse the development of spatial data infrastructures and digital twins in the realm of smart cities, and make sense of big geospatial data in the built environment.
We are particularly interested in the interface of emerging datasets such as street view imagery, 3D urban models, and crowdsourced data with the state of the art of artificial intelligence to solve contemporary urban challenges.

The research group was established in 2019 by its director Dr {{% mention "filip" %}}, Assistant Professor at the [NUS School of Design and Environment](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg) and the [NUS Business School](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg).

We are involved in several international collaborations such as the [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)](https://www.isprs.org) and the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.opengeospatial.org).
Within NUS, we collaborate primarily with three sister labs: the [Building and Urban Data Science (BUDS) Lab](https://www.budslab.org), the [Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) Lab](https://ideaslab.io), and the [Urban Climate Design Lab](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/ucdl/), forming a coherent constellation of nimble research groups with complementary activities and operating at converging scales.
