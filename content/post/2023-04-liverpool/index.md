The PI of the Lab, {{< mention "filip" >}}, represented the research group during a recent visit to Europe where he gave guest lectures and participated in a variety of activities to further our network:

+ University of Liverpool, [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) :uk:
+ Heidelberg University, [GIScience Research Group](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/index_en.html) and [Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology](https://heigit.org) :de:

These labs are leaders in our domain.

The [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) in Liverpool is a multidisciplinary group that serves as a centre of excellence for research and teaching within this emerging area, drawing expertise from the intersection of Geographic Information Science, Spatial Analysis and Applied Geocomputation. It is headed by Professor [Francisco Rowe](https://www.franciscorowe.com).

The [GIScience Research Group](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/index_en.html) and [HeiGIT](https://heigit.org) (Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology) in Heidelberg are one of the leading groups in the domain of geographical information science, especially in user-generated geographical content (VGI, Crowdsourcing, Citizen Science). They are headed by Professor [Alexander Zipf](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/zipf.html).
