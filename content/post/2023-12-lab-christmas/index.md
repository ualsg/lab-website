Happy Holidays from the NUS Urban Analytics Lab & collaborators! üèùÔ∏èü•Ç
For those who celebrate - Merry Christmas! üéÑ

We are proud of what our small research group has achieved this year -- we [released a few open-source software packages and open datasets](/data-code), [gave 40 invited talks in 12 countries](/post) (including [many by our junior researchers]({{< relref "/post/2023-10-activities" >}})), received a [couple]({{< relref "/post/2023-10-ui-best-paper-award" >}}) of [awards]({{< relref "/post/2023-02-cde-awards" >}}), witnessed [the first placements of Lab alumni as faculty elsewhere]({{< relref "/post/2023-02-pengyuan-nanjing" >}}), and had lots of enjoyable collaborations and fun.
With ample exciting research, we wrote some papers as well -- we [published](/publication) more than 20 of them.
For the first time, we started a couple of [industrial collaborations]({{< relref "/post/2023-04-takenaka-collaboration" >}}).

As part of our community engagement, department service, and strengthening our network, we hosted [several visiting scholars and guest lecturers from all over the world](/seminars).

This year also marks the first time that [our National University of Singapore ascended to be ranked within the top 10 universities worldwide]({{< relref "/post/2023-07-qs-ranking" >}}) according to QS (#8).

We look forward to continue our work in 2024, with new advancements serving data-driven urban planning and expand our collaborations.
