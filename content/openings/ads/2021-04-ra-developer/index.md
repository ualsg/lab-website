### Job and project description

The [Urban Analytics Lab](/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) is seeking a research associate to join the research group and spearhead research on 3D city models / BIM, data integration (focusing on crowdsourced and dynamic geospatial data) and use cases, under the umbrella of digital twins.
This position is part of an upcoming large project, spanning multiple scales: human, building, transportation, and urban extents.
The project will be carried out primarily with our two sister labs at NUS: the [Building and Urban Data Science (BUDS) Lab](https://www.budslab.org) and the [Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) Lab](https://ideaslab.io).

This vacancy is advertised concurrently with a related
[postdoc opening.]({{< relref "/openings/ads/2021-04-postdoc/" >}})

The successful applicant will be engaged on novel research lines in the context of digital twins, namely: integration of nascent data sources, initiating new means of benchmarking and quality assessment of data and workflows, and developing new use cases pertaining to building/urban/geospatial data infrastructure in the frame of smart cities.
Positioned at the intersection of academia, industry, international organisations and government, the nature of the work is computational and practical.
It will include implementing software tools, drafting standards, and producing data.
For example, the researcher will be involved in coding translation mechanisms between datasets stored in different formats and spanning different scales, crunching big / dynamic / crowdsourced / geospatial data and developing software to make use of them, and visualisation.
A portion of the project will involve data collection, e.g. imagery and point clouds.

The research fellow will be supervised by the principal investigator [Dr Filip Biljecki](/authors/filip/), [NUS School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

Candidates should have a strong computational affinity and a degree in computer science, geographical information science, geomatics, or another relevant field of study, with a demonstrated track record (in terms of working experience and/or publications/impact and/or other forms of output such as development of tools).

The Lab will provide a motivating, conducive, and flexible environment to explore the research associate's interests and build skills required for future career steps.

*Our research group aims to increase the share of women in research.
Female candidates are therefore encouraged to apply.*

### Scope and responsibilities

Your key responsibilities will be:

- Conducting research activities.
- Development of software tools.
- Collaboration with other researchers and coordination.
- Exploring new research directions and experimenting with new datasets and technologies.
- Assisting the PI in various activities in the research group and project such as supervision/mentorship of students, management, and assisting with funding applications.
- Preparation of publications and managing other forms of research output such as software and data.

### Required qualifications

You should demonstrate that you possess:

- A degree :mortar_board: in a related discipline from a reputable university. Current students are eligible to apply as well, provided that they are in the final stage of their studies and that their degree will be completed before the start of the appointment.
- An ability to conduct research semi-independently.
- A publication record is not required, but candidates with demonstrated impact, writing skills, and a strong affinity to publish are welcome to emphasise these in their application.
- Proficiency in one or more of the following areas: GIS, game engines, Geomatics, 3D city modelling, computer science, urban planning, and/or urban simulations.
- Good communication skills in English, and an ability to present research in both academic and non-academic venues.
- Experience with programming. Having built software used by others and/or scientific software experience is a plus. We will prioritise applicants who can demonstrate these qualities through a Github profile or similar evidence.
- Curiosity and passion to explore new concepts, methods and technologies, and capability of identifying and quickly learning the most suitable tools for the research on the go.
- A positive and proactive stance on open science, preferably with demonstrated activities such as using and developing open-source software, releasing data as open data, and promoting reproducible research. 

### Our offer

- You will be working on compelling research activities at the forefront of geographical information science and urban data science in a new research group that is gaining a strong momentum in Singapore and overseas.
- You will advance your research and transferable skills required for the next stage of your career.
- You will work in a research and educational environment where you may not only contribute to your own development, but also to others, e.g. by supervising master theses that may arise as part of the research.
- Opportunity to make impactful contributions in the field, on a globally relevant and growing topic.
- Visibility and exposure of your work.
- Potential contact with industrial and governmental partners, both locally and internationally.
- A diverse, inclusive, and flexible working environment.
- Exploring new ideas and an opportunity to experiment with the state of the art.
- The remuneration will be determined according to the university's salary range depending on the degree and experience.

__Please note that this is not a PhD position. This is a full-time research job.__

### Duration and start

The appointment is for one year, with a probation period of 3 months.
The contract can be extended for another year subject to performance.
