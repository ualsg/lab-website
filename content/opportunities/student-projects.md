If you are a motivated and talented graduate student, it is possible to conduct your thesis with us.
Each year, we offer supervision and guidance to a few students interested in pursuing projects related to urban data science, GIScience, and 3D city modelling.

Some student projects in the past were accepted for academic conference or even published in leading journals.
Conducting such a project enables the learning of new skills (e.g. tool or programming language), mastering a new multidisciplinary topic, working on a exciting real-world problem, and the possibility of making a real impact.
In principle, most topics require at least a basic level of programming and/or data science, and managing geospatial data.

A thesis can be a great way to gauge your interest in an academic career and boost your applications for PhD programmes.

While the exact topic is shaped based on the interests, learning goals, and skills of the candidate, it would be beneficial if you could come up with a general topic on your own or at least some overall directions.
Feel free to check out past student projects below, and please [get in touch](/#contact) if you are interested in working with us.

### Potential topics

You may [approach us](/#contact) to discuss potential topics for research.
The topics will depend on many factors, such as our [ongoing research projects]({{< relref "../project/" >}}) (in which we might be able to accommodate a student project), [latest publications]({{< relref "../publication/" >}}) (which we may want to extend), and the background/interests/study programme/learning goals of the student.
