abstract: 'Urban spaces have become complex, being shaped by diverse human behaviours. Therefore, the sustainability of development has faced various challenges ranging from pollution to equity in accessibility to activity spaces and opportunities. Using spatial big data and new computing technologies is an effective way to a better understanding of the interaction between individuals and urban environments, which would be beneficial to tackle urban challenges. This workshop focuses on new advanced technologies on spatial data representation and interoperability, geo-computation and -simulation, and GeoAI, which can harness human behaviour related spatial big data, discovering the mechanisms of the interaction between human behaviours and urban environments.'
