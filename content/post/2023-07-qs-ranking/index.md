In a historic first for the University, NUS has broken into the worldwide top 10, according to results from the latest Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings (WUR) released on 28 June 2023. Now ranking 8th in the world, NUS is also the top university in Asia.

The University leapt three spots in this year’s rankings after holding steady at 11th for the past five years. This puts NUS within the top 1 per cent of all universities evaluated this year, ranking among many highly prestigious institutions worldwide.

Launched in 2003 and now in its 20th edition, the QS WUR is a portfolio of comparative university rankings released annually. The 2024 edition features 2,963 evaluated institutions across 104 locations, and is based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, global engagement, and sustainability.

“We are delighted with NUS’ excellent performance, ranking 8th in the world and top in Asia according to the latest QS World University Rankings, and the recognition accorded as one of the leading universities in the world, and in Asia. This is a historic first for NUS to be placed within the top ten globally, amongst many other prestigious institutions worldwide,” said NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye.

“This is a testament to our capabilities and commitment to providing a world-class, and interdisciplinary education to nurture agile and resilient graduates with diverse skills and knowledge for an ever-changing world. This achievement was made possible by the excellent contributions and outstanding work of our talented faculty, staff and students who remain deeply committed to flying the flag of our distinguished quality of education and creating positive impact in the classroom and beyond.”

"We are thrilled to acknowledge the historic achievement of the National University of Singapore in joining the top 10 of the 20th of the QS World University Rankings," shared Ms Jessica Turner, QS Chief Executive. "This unprecedented milestone marks a remarkable moment for Asian higher education and showcases NUS' dedication to research excellence, innovation, and sustainability."

She further added, "NUS' remarkable ascent not only highlights its outstanding academic performance but also underscores its commitment to producing graduates sought after by employers, as demonstrated by its impressive 7th place globally in the new Employment Outcomes indicator. The university's distinguished faculty and researchers play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge and making significant contributions across diverse fields."

**NUS ranks within top universities in Asia**

NUS has also been consistently ranked among the best universities in Asia. The University came in third place for the fourth consecutive year in the latest ranking of Asian universities released by Times Higher Education (THE) on 22 June 2023.

China’s Tsinghua University topped the list, with Peking University placed second in the 11th edition of THE’s Asia University Rankings.

Comprising 669 universities from 31 territories, the 2023 ranking assessed the universities on their core missions – teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. The THE Asia University Rankings is based on the same 13 performance indicators used in THE’s World University Rankings, which are recalibrated to reflect the attributes of Asia’s institutions. NUS was ranked 19th in the 2023 THE World University Rankings.
