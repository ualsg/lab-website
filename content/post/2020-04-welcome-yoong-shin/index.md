We welcome {{% mention "yoong-shin" %}} as new full-time researcher in the group.

She will be working on a [new project]({{< ref "/project/3d-open/index.md" >}}) on developing a method to generate 3D city models using geographic data science and machine learning.
The work aspires to create 3D city models of cities that do not have 3D data yet, which would open the door for environmental analyses and other urban analytics purposes.

Yoong Shin has studied in the United States, and has a rich experience (15+ years) in the IT industry in different roles.
She is also active in the local Python community -- [PyCon SG](https://pycon.sg).

Welcome, Yoong Shin!
