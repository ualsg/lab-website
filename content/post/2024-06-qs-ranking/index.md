### NUS at world No. 8 and top in Asia in QS World University Rankings 2025

NUS has reaffirmed its strong reputation as a global leader in higher education, placing eighth in the world and first in Asia, based on the latest Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings (WUR) 2025 released on 4 June 2024.

This year, the annual comparative ranking features 1,500 universities across 106 locations, including four universities from Singapore. The latest ranking results position NUS among the top 0.5% of universities worldwide and the only Asian university among the top 10.

‚ÄúHigher education in Singapore has transformed significantly as universities expand the space for interdisciplinary teaching and research with greater pace and scale, so that it becomes second nature for graduates to be critical thinkers and flexible learners, while faculty and researchers join hands and bridge discipline silos to solve the ill-defined world problems of today. As a leading global university, NUS continues to push the boundaries in education, research, innovation and enterprise, challenging students to learn and unlearn, grow in adaptability and resilience, and discover a world beyond themselves,‚Äù said NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye.

Prof Tan attributed NUS‚Äô strong performance to the collective achievement of the University‚Äôs outstanding faculty, staff, students, and alumni.

‚ÄúThis year, most notably, NUS has made considerable progress in the Sustainability indicator, a testament to our whole-of-university approach to shape a sustainable future through interdisciplinary solutions across education, research, and campus operations. The NUS community remains resolute in our commitment to foster a vibrant and dynamic academic environment which inspires and drives positive impact for everyone,‚Äù he added.

#### Consistently strong performance across key indicators

Among the nine indicators used to derive the world rankings, NUS ranks among the world‚Äôs top 50 in five indicators. The University is also one of Asia‚Äôs top-performing universities in three indicators.

In Academic Reputation, NUS ranks 15th globally, making it the third highest in Asia behind The University of Tokyo and Peking University. In Employment Outcomes, NUS excels by placing 6th globally, second only to Seoul National University. For Sustainability, NUS ranks 26th globally, after The University of Tokyo, which is ranked 22nd. In Singapore, NUS emerged the top performer in eight out of nine indicators.
