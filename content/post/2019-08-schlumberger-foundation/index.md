The Schlumberger Foundation is accepting new applications for the 2020–2021 [Faculty for the Future Fellowships](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net) from September 5th to November 7th, 2019.
The program’s long-term goal is to generate conditions that result in more women pursuing scientific
careers by lowering the barriers women face when entering STEM disciplines, thus reducing the gender
gap.

The fellowship is open to female applicants from developing countries and emerging economies. 

If you are interested in topics such as urban analytics, GIS, and 3D city modelling and if you are [eligible](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net/content/grant-application-process) to apply, we are open in working together on your application.
Feel free to [contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}}).
