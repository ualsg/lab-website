![HFT Stuttgart visit to SDE](1.jpeg)

We are pleased to have been visited by a group of master students studying at the [Stuttgart Technology University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f√ºr Technik)](https://www.hft-stuttgart.de) in Germany.
The visit was accompanied by [Prof Alias Abdul Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WHwZRQ0AAAAJ&hl=en) ([Universiti Teknologi Malaysia - UTM](https://www.utm.my)).

The students are spending their summer on a study trip in Southeast Asia, and during their visit to Singapore they learned more about NUS, and GIS and Geomatics research and teaching activities of our lab.

The group was also given a tour of [SDE4](https://www.arch.nus.edu.sg/about/facilities/net-zero-energy-building-sde-4/) - the new building of our school, notable for being [the first net-zero energy building in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/nus-launches-singapores-first-net-zero-energy-building-to-be-built-from).
