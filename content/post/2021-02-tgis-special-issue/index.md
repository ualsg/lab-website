The section of the [latest issue of Transactions in GIS](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14679671/2021/25/1), titled _Emerging topics in 3D GIS_, represents a collection of approaches to acquire, analyse, and utilise 3D geospatial and Building Information Modelling (BIM) data.

The special issue has been edited by {{% mention "filip" %}}, [Rudi Stouffs](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/staffs/rudi-stouffs-dr/), and [Mohsen Kalantari](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/99751-mohsen-kalantari-soltanieh), and it has been published in the February 2021 issue (vol. 25, issue 1) of the journal.

The issue aims at providing an insight in the latest developments and applications in advanced 3D data and technologies, encompassing topics from 3D city models acquisition and processing to BIM and 3D spatial data analysis.
A part of this special issue arises from the [3D GeoInfo 2019 Conference and the 2th BIM/GIS Integration Workshop organised in Singapore]({{< relref "/post/2019-09-3d-geoinfo-success" >}}).
The authors [were given an opportunity]({{< relref "/post/2019-09_TGIS_3D_special_issue" >}}) to extend their research papers published in [the proceedings of the event](https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-4-W8/), but this issue was also open to other researchers working on the state of the art of the topics covered by the event.

This special issue consists of an editorial and eleven research papers (see below) that represent the latest emerging topics in 3D GIS and cover a number of important aspects of 3D spatial data science and BIM.
Six of these papers are open access <i class="ai ai-open-access-square ai"></i>.

The guest editors thank all authors and reviewers for their valuable contribution making this special issue possible.
We also want to express our gratitude to the editorial team of Transactions in GIS, especially the Editor-in-Chief John P. Wilson and the Editorial Board member Feng Chen-Chieh.
The participants and sponsors of 3D Singapore, and the Singapore Land Authority and the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, are gratefully acknowledged for their role in the event from which this special issue stems.
