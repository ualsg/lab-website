## Open applications and general info about positions

We appreciate open enquiries from motivated prospective PhD candidates, research assistants, postdoctoral research fellows, and visiting scholars but we expect dedicated applications.
Before applying, please read the sections below.

We want to hear about your specific interest and expect you to have at least a basic understanding of what we do and what our research lines are about.
We suggest that you have a look at one of our [publications](/publication), provide your perspective and motivation (e.g. write a short proposal how you would take these results further), and let us know how do you envision contributing to our research group.
In your application, please highlight your computational, programming, and geospatial skills.
Your experience should be evident from the courses followed, publications, and your GitHub account.

While we appreciate interest, we cannot entertain generic applications without a clear motivation and understanding of the scope of our work.

### Postdocs

Postdoctoral research fellows are expected to be moderately independent, spearhead new research initiatives, contribute to funding applications, and provide guidance to junior members.
Our Lab enables an environment that accords a degree of freedom in exploring own research ideas, and fosters careers of postdocs in several ways such as support to attend conferences and involvements in multiple projects and collaborations.

We announce available postdoc positions in the openings section above, but you are welcome to send an open application, as sometimes there might be a new funded project just around the corner.
Other than that, we welcome prospective postdoctoral fellows on fellowships (see [the other page](../fellowships/) for some options).

### PhD candidates and research assistants

Working as RA and/or doing a PhD at NUS is a great opportunity to grow as a scientist and follow your passion in research, and our Lab offers a vibrant and stimulating environment for academic growth.
RA positions depend on funded projects.
We announce available RA positions in the openings section above, but you are also welcome to send an open application.
Computational/programming skills are a must.

[We accept well-motivated and talented prospective PhD candidates](../ads/phd-geospatial), but we do not admit them directly as the applications are processed by the school.
Please read more [here](../phd).

### Visiting scholars and research visits

Feel free to get in touch with us if you are interested in conducting a research visit at the Urban Analytics Lab.

Please prepare a short proposal of the research you plan to conduct in our Lab together with a timeline and other specifics.
Feel free to have a look at our website and recent papers, and think of a common overlap or complementary research direction, which will ensure a mutually beneficial research visit.
Potential contributions to our research group are also important.
Every year, we have bandwidth to accept only a few visiting researchers.
Thus, we prefer to prioritise those who work on research that is closely aligned with our activities and ensure a complementary fit and contribution to our projects and team.

Depending on your country of residence and position, sometimes there are opportunities for a funded stay, such as the [French-Singaporean research collaboration programme Merlion](https://www.campusfrance.org/fr/merlion), [China Scholarship Council](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com), and the [US Fulbright Program](https://www.cies.org).

External (non-NUS) students can carry out a portion of their research at our Lab in the form of a research visit.
Please refer to the [NUS Non-Graduating Programme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/non-graduating/research) for the framework of the scheme.

## Thesis and internship opportunities for BSc/MSc students

Every year, we accept a number of highly motivated and talented students from NUS Architecture, Real Estate and Geography, Yale-NUS College, and other related departments to work on graduation projects (theses, capstones) in our research domain.

Such mode of work has been mutually productive, as above average quality projects [have been published in top journals or conferences](/publication), enhancing students' CVs and boosting their applications to PhD programmes.
At the same time, the multidisciplinary spectrum and interest of the students and the research has enriched the breadth of expertise and knowledge of the Lab.
Further, the students have used this opportunity to advance their analytical, coding, and research skills, and build proficiency in a new topic of their interest.

If you are looking for a topic, have a look at [existing projects](/opportunities/student-projects#theses-dissertations-and-capstone-projects) (the link also includes examples of completed theses) to get an impression of the scope.
It is possible to adapt a topic to suit your background and interest, and we [embrace diverse backgrounds]({{< ref "/post/2020-11-new-student-researchers/index.md" >}}). 

When it comes to internships, due to limited supervision resources, we are able to offer guidance to only a few motivated students per semester, who are required to conduct an internship to fulfil their graduation requirements.
We prefer students who are highly motivated, have solid background knowledge for the topic, computational skills, and are fairly independent.
You may [contact us](/#contact) if interested.
Before doing so, please browse through our website to get an impression about our ongoing work.

In principle, we are not able to offer internships to students who are not studying at our university or at the [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg).
However, there are exceptions.
For example, we are accepting undergraduates from universities in Germany thanks to the [DAAD RISE Worldwide program](https://www.daad.de/rise/de/rise-weltweit/).
If your university or country has a similar programme, or if you have another funding arrangement to come and spend time in Singapore, feel free to contact us.

Occasionally there are student research jobs opportunities, which are advertised on the NUS internal student job portal (NSWS) when available.

## Contact

Are some of the options listed above of your interest or you have a general enquiry?
Feel free to get in touch with us through email (listed on the [home page](/#contact)).
While we appreciate interest, we cannot attend to generic applications without a clear motivation and understanding of the scope of our work.
