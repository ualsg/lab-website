Applications to the PhD programme should be done directly to the [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg), and you are advised to [first get in touch with us to discuss mutual interest](/#contact).
Please send us an up-to-date CV and a brief proposal containing a summary of the topics that you find interesting and how you plan to fill existing gaps in knowledge, summary of any prior research outputs (code, papers, internships, thesis, etc.), a review of one of our [publications](/publication), and a brief literature review that covers recent developments in your area of interest.

The [NUS website on graduate admissions](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/graduate) is a good starting point to get more information about doing a PhD at our university.
The application deadlines are usually 15 November for the intake in August next year, and 15 May for the start in January.
Please start preparing early, and indicate in your application that you would like to be supervised by Dr {{< mention "filip" >}}.

Sometimes there are [scholarship opportunities by the school](http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/school-of-design-and-environment/graduate-education/financial-assistance-and-scholarships/) and also by the [university](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/graduate/scholarship) to partially or fully fund your PhD journey, and there are external funding options.
Do also check the [comprehensive list](../fellowships) that we prepared for candidates seeking external funding.
For example, if applicable to you, check out the [The Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net) for a potential scholarship opportunity.
Please note that most external scholarship programmes require a candidate to be admitted to a PhD programme before applying for funding (e.g. providing the letter of acceptance from the university).
Thus, we recommend starting as soon as possible.

You may also want to read the graduate studies website of either the [Department of Architecture](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/higher-degrees-by-research/) (and its [FAQ](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/higher-degrees-by-research/frequently-asked-questions/)), or the [Department of Real Estate](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/rst/graduate/graduate-courses-by-research/hdegree-admission/) (we are part of both).
