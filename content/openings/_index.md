Thank you for your interest in our research group.
Please find below the list of possible schemes to get involved, primarily [openings](#openings) we have subject to funding and projects.

Our research group aims to increase the share of women in research.
Female candidates are therefore encouraged to apply.

## Aims and why us

We are excited to grow a new research group focused on the nexus of 3D geoinformation, urban analytics, and geospatial data science.
Working at our Lab presents a rare opportunity in Singapore and Southeast Asia to be involved in the entire 3D GIS ecosystem under the same roof: from standardisation and generation of 3D city models all the way to their utilisation and visualisation, while continuously exploring new frontiers in the field. 

Our [department](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/) is consistently [ranked among the best in the world]({{< ref "/post/2021-03-qs-ranking/index.md" >}}).

Working at NUS means being part of a leading global university centred in Asia (the #1 university in Asia and world's #11 according to QS 2021), and having access to an extensive network of experts across myriads of domains.
Beyond the university, our network and collaborations span scores of researchers around the world working on a variety of topics.
Our Lab is located at SDE4, [the first newly-built net-zero energy building in Singapore]({{< ref "/post/2020-12-sde4-ilfi/index.md" >}}), and the first university building in the world to be [WELL Certified Gold](https://www.wellcertified.com/).

Singapore is a cosmopolitan English-speaking city-state bridging the East and the West.
It is considered as the [#1 most competitive country](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-economy-ranked-worlds-most-competitive) and the [safest country in the world](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/singapore-ranked-safest-country-world-above-japan-survey), [successfully attracting talents from all parts of the globe](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-retains-top-spot-in-asia-pacific-index-for-talent-competitiveness) by offering first-class living and working experience in the heart of Southeast Asia, and a very clean, efficient and low-tax environment.
And great food and weather, of course.

## Open applications and general info about positions

We appreciate open enquiries from motivated prospective PhD candidates, research assistants, postdoctoral research fellows, and visiting scholars but we expect dedicated applications.
Before applying, please read the sections below.

We want to hear about your specific interest and expect you to have at least a basic understanding of what we do and what our research lines are about.
We suggest that you have a look at one of our [publications](/publication), provide your perspective and motivation (e.g. write a short proposal how you would take these results further), and let us know how do you envision contributing to our research group.
In your application, please highlight your computational, programming, and geospatial skills.
Your experience should be evident from the courses followed, publications, and your GitHub account.

While we appreciate interest, we cannot entertain generic applications without a clear motivation and understanding of the scope of our work.

### Postdocs

Postdoctoral research fellows are expected to be moderately independent, spearhead new research initiatives, contribute to funding applications, and provide guidance to junior members.
Our Lab enables an environment that accords a degree of freedom in exploring own research ideas, and fosters careers of postdocs in several ways such as support to attend conferences and involvements in multiple projects and collaborations.

We announce available postdoc positions in the [openings section](#openings) above, but you are welcome to send an open application, as sometimes there might be a new funded project just around the corner.
Other than that, we welcome prospective postdoctoral fellows on fellowships (see [below](#fellowship-opportunities) for some options).

### PhD candidates and research assistants

Working as RA and/or doing a PhD at NUS is a great opportunity to grow as a scientist and follow your passion in research, and our Lab offers a vibrant and stimulating environment for academic growth.
RA positions depend on funded projects.
We announce available RA positions in the [openings section](#openings) above, but you are also welcome to send an open application.
Computational/programming skills are a must.

[We accept well-motivated and talented prospective PhD candidates](ads/phd-geospatial), but we do not admit them directly as the applications are processed by the school.
Please read more [below](#doing-a-phd).

### Visiting scholars and research visits

Feel free to get in touch with us if you are interested in conducting a research visit at the Urban Analytics Lab.

Please prepare a short proposal of the research you plan to conduct in our Lab together with a timeline and other specifics.
Feel free to have a look at our website and recent papers, and think of a common overlap or complementary research direction, which will ensure a mutually beneficial research visit.
Potential contributions to our research group are also important.
Every year, we have bandwidth to accept only a few visiting researchers.
Thus, we prefer to prioritise those who work on research that is closely aligned with our activities and ensure a complementary fit and contribution to our projects and team.

Depending on your country of residence and position, sometimes there are opportunities for a funded stay, such as the [French-Singaporean research collaboration programme Merlion](https://www.campusfrance.org/fr/merlion), [China Scholarship Council](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com), and the [US Fulbright Program](https://www.cies.org).

External (non-NUS) students can carry out a portion of their research at our Lab in the form of a research visit.
Please refer to the [NUS Non-Graduating Programme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/non-graduating/research) for the framework of the scheme.

## Doing a PhD

Applications to the PhD programme should be done directly to the [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg), and you are advised to [first get in touch with us to discuss mutual interest](/#contact).
Please send us an up-to-date CV and a brief proposal containing a summary of the topics that you find interesting and how you plan to fill existing gaps in knowledge, summary of any prior research outputs (code, papers, internships, thesis, etc.), a review of one of our [publications](/publication), and a brief literature review that covers recent developments in your area of interest.

The [NUS website on graduate admissions](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/graduate) is a good starting point to get more information about doing a PhD at our university.
The application deadlines are usually 15 November for the intake in August next year, and 15 May for the start in January.
Please start preparing early, and indicate in your application that you would like to be supervised by Dr {{< mention "filip" >}}.

Sometimes there are [scholarship opportunities by the school](http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/school-of-design-and-environment/graduate-education/financial-assistance-and-scholarships/) and also by the [university](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/graduate/scholarship) to partially or fully fund your PhD journey, and there are external funding options.
Do also check the [comprehensive list](#fellowship-opportunities) in the continuation of this web page, which we prepared for candidates seeking external funding.
For example, if applicable to you, check out the [The Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net) for a potential scholarship opportunity.
Please note that most external scholarship programmes require a candidate to be admitted to a PhD programme before applying for funding (e.g. providing the letter of acceptance from the university).
Thus, we recommend starting as soon as possible.

You may also want to read the graduate studies website of either the [Department of Architecture](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/higher-degrees-by-research/) (and its [FAQ](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/higher-degrees-by-research/frequently-asked-questions/)), or the [Department of Real Estate](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/rst/graduate/graduate-courses-by-research/hdegree-admission/) (we are part of both).


## Thesis and internship opportunities for BSc/MSc students

Every year, we accept a number of highly motivated and talented students from NUS Architecture, Real Estate and Geography, Yale-NUS College, and other related departments to work on graduation projects (theses, capstones) in our research domain.

Such mode of work has been mutually productive, as above average quality projects [have been published in top journals or conferences](/publication), enhancing students' CVs and boosting their applications to PhD programmes.
At the same time, the multidisciplinary spectrum and interest of the students and the research has enriched the breadth of expertise and knowledge of the Lab.
Further, the students have used this opportunity to advance their analytical, coding, and research skills, and build proficiency in a new topic of their interest.

If you are looking for a topic, have a look at [existing projects](/teaching/#theses-dissertations-and-capstone-projects) (the link also includes examples of completed theses) to get an impression of the scope.
It is possible to adapt a topic to suit your background and interest, and we [embrace diverse backgrounds]({{< ref "/post/2020-11-new-student-researchers/index.md" >}}). 

When it comes to internships, due to limited supervision resources, we are able to offer guidance to only a few motivated students per semester, who are required to conduct an internship to fulfil their graduation requirements.
We prefer students who are highly motivated, have solid background knowledge for the topic, computational skills, and are fairly independent.
You may [contact us](/#contact) if interested.
Before doing so, please browse through our website to get an impression about our ongoing work.

In principle, we are not able to offer internships to students who are not studying at our university or at the [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg).
However, there are exceptions.
For example, we are accepting undergraduates from universities in Germany thanks to the [DAAD RISE Worldwide program](https://www.daad.de/rise/de/rise-weltweit/).
If your university or country has a similar programme, or if you have another funding arrangement to come and spend time in Singapore, feel free to contact us.

Occasionally there are student research jobs opportunities, which are advertised on the NUS internal student job portal (NSWS) when available.

## Fellowship opportunities
