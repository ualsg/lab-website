We are an interdepartmental multidisciplinary research group established in 2019 focusing on urban analytics, geographic data science, and 3D city modelling at the [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg), [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg), the #1 ranked university in Asia and world's #11 (QS). 

Our mission is to leverage on spatially enabled data for urban applications, catalyse the development of 3D geoinformation in the context of smart cities, make sense of big geospatial data and digital twins in the built environment, and cater to disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, and real estate to make informed decisions using 3D city models and urban analytics.
We appreciate the importance of geoinformation powering urban informatics, and put a particular focus on the geospatial infrastructure and technology supporting it.

The lab is led by Dr {{% mention "filip" %}}, asst prof at NUS [Architecture](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/) and [Real Estate](http://www.rst.nus.edu.sg).

We are involved in several international collaborations such as the [World Economic Forum (WEF)](https://www.weforum.org), the [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)](https://www.isprs.org), and the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.opengeospatial.org).
On the national level, we have collaborations with Singapore Government agencies and companies.
