All three recent visiting scholars, who spent a year in our Lab, have won this year's China National Scholarship for PhDs by the government, which is the highest scholarship in the country and among the most competitive ones (awarded to top few percents of students). :trophy:

Big congratulations to {{< mention "junjie" >}} (Tianjin University), {{< mention "tianhong" >}} (Shenzhen University), and {{< mention "yan-zhang" >}} (Wuhan University) for this top achievement. :clap:

During their stay, they also published [papers](/publication/) in leading journals.

We are honoured to have you hosted in our research group and wish you continued success in your next steps.
