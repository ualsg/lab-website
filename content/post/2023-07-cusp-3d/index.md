{{< mention "binyu" >}} and {{< mention "filip" >}} gave a keynote presentation at [3D Urban Models: Applications and Digital Twins](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/3d-urban-models-applications-and-digital-twins-tickets-657449387817), an online event that was part of the [London Data Week](https://www.londondataweek.org), focusing on a wide range of 3D City model related topics: new visualization methods and future trends in VR, AR & Digital Twins.

The event was organised by the [Centre for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/cusp), King's College London.

We presented our research on urban data modelling and digital twins.
For the latest publications on this topic, check out [our papers](/publication).
Also, make sure to check Binyu's [latest paper]({{< relref "/post/2023-07-gim-article-dt" >}}) on uncovering challenges to the adoption and management of digital twins in the urban realm.

We appreciate the invitation and thank Professor [Nick Holliman](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/nicolas-s.-holliman) and his colleagues for the organisation.
