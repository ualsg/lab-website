Dr {{< mention "pengyuan" >}}, who has been a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in our Lab, is now an Assistant Professor at the Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology.

Pengyuan joined our [NUS Urban Analytics Lab](/) in early 2022 to work on a project on digital twins, after his PhD at the University of Leicester and research at the University of Helsinki.
At our group, he worked on several papers (check out his publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XZXvFD0AAAAJ)) and mentored junior researchers.

Pengyuan is the first member of our young research group to assume a faculty position, and it goes without saying that we are proud to have him as our Lab's alumnus.
We thank him for the collaboration so far and we wish him all the best in his endeavours.
We are sure that he will have a great future in academia.

Congratulations! :clap:
