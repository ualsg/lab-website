As we are nearing the end of the year, it is time to reflect and be grateful for all the progress we made in 2021.

The list of our papers published so far is [here](/publication/), while our news items are available at our [blog](/post/).
We also released a couple of [software packages and datasets](/data-code/), that may be of interest to the wider community.

Projects

Lots of fun stuff


A study led by Stanford University has identified top 2% scientists worldwide in a variety of fields.
The [Director](/authors/filip/) of the Lab is on the list.
For more information about the study, see the dataset ["Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators"](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/3) and their papers published in PLOS Biology indicating the motivation and methodology ([here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000384) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000918)).

We are especially happy to celebrate the achievements of our master students.
Four papers first-authored or co-authored by master students have been published in leading journals this year, such as [Computers, Environment and Urban Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems).
