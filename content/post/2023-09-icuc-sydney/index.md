The [11th edition of the International Conference on Urban Climate (ICUC)](https://icuc11.com/) was hosted in Sydney, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.
This truly multidisciplinary conference was organised by the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au).

Big thanks to [Negin Nazarian](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-negin-nazarian) and [Melissa Hart](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-melissa-anne-hart) for the meticulous and smooth organisation.

Our research group and others from the National University of Singapore were well represented.
In particular, we shared details about two ongoing projects.

{{< mention "marcel" >}} presented his multidisciplinary project _Data-driven models for understanding urban canopy air temperature distribution: a case study in the tropics_.
This work is being carried out in collaboration with {{< mention "kunihiko" >}}.
More information about this research can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcelignatius_icuc11sydney-urbanclimate-microclimateanalysis-activity-7106133611975737344-Am9u).

{{< mention "filip" >}} has shared details on the investigations on _Crowdsourced imagery for urban climate informatics_, conducted with {{< mention "tianhong" >}}, {{< mention "xiucheng" >}}, and {{< mention "yujun" >}}.
Further, together with Mathew Lipson (Australian Bureau of Meteorology), he co-chaired the session _Urban data for climate modelling and sustainable cities_, which included contributions from several countries.

Also, he gave a guest lecture at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au) -- [Heat & Health Research Incubator](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-centres/heat-and-health-research-incubator.html). 
Many thanks to [Federico Tartarini](https://federicotartarini.github.io) for hosting it.
