This paper brings a comprehensive systematic review of the application of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography studies, including the subdomains of cultural, economic, political, historical, urban, population, social, health, rural, regional, tourism, behavioural, environmental and transport geography. In this extensive review, we obtain 14,537 papers from the Web of Science in the relevant fields and select 1516 papers that we identify as human geography studies using GeoAI via human scanning conducted by several research groups around the world. We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains. We find out that existing human geography studies have limited capacity to monitor complex human behaviour and examine the non-linear relationship between human behaviour and its potential driversâ€”such limits can be overcome by GeoAI models with the capacity to handle complexity. We elaborate on the current progress and status of GeoAI applications within each subdomain of human geography, point out the issues and challenges, as well as propose the directions and research opportunities for using GeoAI in future human geography studies in the context of sustainable and open science, generative AI, and quantum revolution.
