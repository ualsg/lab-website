[State of the Map (SOTM)](https://stateofthemap.org) is the yearly summit of the [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org) community.
[This year's event](https://2020.stateofthemap.org) moved online, together with an academic track.

It has been a great pleasure that our Lab participated in it, with a talk by {{< mention "filip" >}}, co-authored by {{< mention "li-min" >}}, presenting ongoing work  which is part of our main project [Large-scale 3D Geospatial Data for Urban Analytics]({{< ref "/project/3d-open/index.md" >}}).

The papers of the academic track are published open access at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/sotm-2020/), including our [contribution]({{< ref "/publication/2020-sotm-3-d/index.md" >}}).

Besides the [talks](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/programme/), consider checking out the [posters](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/posters/) as well.

Thanks to the organisers for this wonderful event, and to the [sponsors](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/#sponsors) for supporting it!
