We are continuously open to admit motivated and talented prospective PhD candidates and have them join our research group.
However, research groups at NUS usually do not admit them directly and do not provide stipends.

Applications to the PhD programme should be done directly to our [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

That said, you are advised to [get in touch with us to discuss mutual interest and fit](/#contact).
Please send us an up-to-date CV (please highlight your computational, programming, and geospatial skills), a brief research proposal containing a summary of the topics that you find interesting and formulating existing gaps and how do you plan to fill them, summary of prior research outputs (code, papers, internships, thesis, etc. preferably with evidence such as developed GitHub repositories), a review of one of our [publications](/publication) with brief ideas how would you take these results further and/or how would you use them for your research, a statement how do you envision contributing to our research group, and a short literature review that covers recent developments in your area of interest.
Most of these documents will be required later for the official application to the graduate programme.

While we appreciate interest, we do not respond to generic applications and those without a clear motivation and understanding of the scope of our work.
We are more likely to reply and support prospective candidates who have made effort to do a bit of research on what we do and those that are able to motivate their wish to join us in particular.
This is most evident from a tailored application pertaining to our Lab.

The [NUS website on graduate admissions](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/graduate) is a good starting point to get more information about doing a PhD at our university.
The application deadlines are usually 15 November for the intake in August next year, and 15 May for the start in January.
Please start preparing early, and indicate in your application that you would like to be supervised by Dr {{< mention "filip" >}}.

While the current reality of academia is that obtaining longterm and full scholarships for a PhD is unfortunately often difficult and highly competitive, securing funding is not impossible.
Some of our members and others at our department have been successful in obtaining it.
There are [scholarship opportunities](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/scholarships/) to partially or fully fund your PhD journey, and there are external funding options as well.
There are also [financial aid schemes](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/financial-aid/).
Do also check the [comprehensive list](../fellowships) that we prepared for candidates seeking external funding.
For example, if applicable to you, check out the [The Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net) for a potential scholarship opportunity.
Please note that most external scholarship programmes require a candidate to be admitted to a PhD programme before applying for funding (e.g. providing the letter of acceptance from the university).
Thus, we recommend starting as soon as possible.
If there is a match, we'll be happy to endorse your application.
