We were quite active in the past months.
Besides our work being [featured at a high profile event]({{< ref "/post/2021-03-geo-connect-asia/index.md" >}}), we had a bunch of internal activities: we were fortunate to be able to host three guest speakers as part of our master of urban planning module on urban data science, and we had also organised a few lab seminars.

### Guest lectures

The first guest lecture was given by Zhongwen Huang, an urban planner and Director of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Digital Planning Lab, on the topic of Urban Planning 2.0.
Very impressive work.

Second, our {{% mention "abraham" %}} presented [Roofpedia](/project/roofpedia/), his ongoing project on mapping solar and green roofs around the world.
Abraham has developed an approach to automatically identify specific rooftops across 17 cities that contribute towards sustainable development.

The third guest lecture was given by [Dmitry Shkolnik](https://twitter.com/dshkol), a data scientist/economist at Grab, on the topic of _Carving out a niche with (and for) R at Grab_.
Dmitry also presented his personal projects, e.g. R packages he has developed. 
Make sure to check his [blog](https://www.dshkol.com) containing very cool analyses.

### Lab seminars

We are happy that, amid the pandemic, we could manage to organise an in-person lab seminar hosting an external speaker.
[Cai Wu](https://people.utwente.nl/c.wu), a doctoral candidate at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, presented his work _Simulating The Urban Spatial Structure With Spatial Interaction_.
His work includes also Singapore as a study area.
Cai, thanks for visiting us, we wish you success with your PhD journey.

Finally, our graduate students {{% mention "koichi" %}} and {{% mention "wangyang" %}} updated us on their progress and plans for further research.
Both are working on master theses that advance the applications of deep learning in urban planning.
Wangyang is working on developing a deep learning-based method to classify urban morphology and relate it to urban vitality, while Koichi is investigating the usability of street view imagery for assessing bikeability (with Singapore and Tokyo as case studies).

Thanks to everyone for sharing their cool work! :pray:
