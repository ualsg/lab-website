We are active in the following teaching activities at the National University of Singapore:

- [Teaching master courses](#graduate-courses)
- [Supervising theses and dissertations](#theses-and-dissertations)

Please see below for more information.

## Graduate courses

Our teaching activities span multiple modules offered as part of different master programmes at the School of Design and Environment:

**RE5015 Spatial Information Systems (SIS) for Urban Planning (Semester 1)**

- This introductory module to GIS and Cartography is compulsory for [Master in Urban Planning](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-urban-planning/) and [Master of Arts in Urban Design](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-arts-in-urban-design/) students, and it is recommended for [MSc in Real Estate](http://www.rst.nus.edu.sg/graduate/msc-programme.html) students.
The course is also open to students from outside the School of Design and Environment, subject to a quota.
In this course we teach the basics of geographical information science and give a thorough tutorial of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org), supported by assignments relevant to urban planning and real estate.

**AR5953G Geographic Data Science and Urban Analytics (Semester 2)**

- This new module is designed for students who wish to start with (geographic) data science and urban analytics. 
The course is heavily focused on data visualisation, and it includes programming in R.
To get a glimpse into this course, check out our [blog series about this course](/tags/2020-teaching-series/).

**DEP5111 Planning Technologies (Semester 2)**

- A new compulsory [Master in Urban Planning](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/master-of-urban-planning/) module designed to acquaint students with the state of the art of urban planning technologies and research questions from practice.
The course is given in partnership with the Digital Planning Lab of the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](https://www.ura.gov.sg/).

**Guest lectures and workshops**

- We also participate in occasional lectures and workshops at other study programmes at NUS: Master of Landscape Architecture, Master of Science in Applied GIS, and BA in Architecture.


## Theses and dissertations

We welcome motivated undergrad and grad students to conduct their thesis research with us.
We offer guidance in pursuing several projects (scroll down to see the offered [topics](#potential-topics)) in the domain of GIS, 3D city modelling, and urban analytics.
Some of the student projects in the past have been successful resulting in conference and journal papers, benefiting to the outreach of the research and the graduates' CVs.
Our novel assignments enable students to learn new skills (e.g. tool or programming language), learn about a new multidisciplinary topic, work on a exciting real-world problem, and have the potential to have an impact.

Non-NUS students (both from other Singaporean and overseas universities) are eligible to work with us as well, please see the [NUS Non-graduating research student scheme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/non-graduating) if interested.

### Potential topics

We have a list of potential topics for research (please see below), or have a look at our [ongoing research projects]({{< relref "../project/" >}}) in which there is always a plenty of ideas for student projects.
The topics are mostly general, and the candidate is expected to refine a topic further.
The topics are not carved in stone, and may be adapted to suit the student's background and interest.

While many of the topics are technical and require coding, there are also less technical topics.

Are you interested in one of the topics below? Get in [touch](/openings/#contact).
Or feel free to propose your own topic that is within the lab's domain of research.
You can also check out our [blog](/post), we have published some analyses that could be extended into a thesis.
