Thanks for your interest in conducting a PhD with us at the National University of Singapore.

We welcome motivated and talented prospective PhD candidates in our research group.
However, research groups at NUS usually do not admit them directly and do not provide stipends. Applications to the PhD programme should be done directly to our [School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

That said, [do get in touch with us](/#contact) beforehand to discuss mutual interest and fit.
Before contacting us and applying to the PhD programme, you are advised to read this page in detail, which contains information for prospective doctoral candidates.
Furthermore, there is a large number of articles, blog posts, and guides elsewhere on how to make your PhD application stand out, so make sure you read those as well.

### Why us

The [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) is ranked consistently as one of the world's top universities.
It aspires to be a vital community of academics, researchers, staff, students and alumni working together in a spirit of innovation and enterprise for a better world.

Singapore is a cosmopolitan English-speaking city-state bridging the East and the West.
It is considered as the [#1 most competitive country](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-economy-ranked-worlds-most-competitive) and the [safest country in the world](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/singapore-ranked-safest-country-world-above-japan-survey), [successfully attracting talents from all parts of the globe](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-retains-top-spot-in-asia-pacific-index-for-talent-competitiveness) by offering first-class living and working experience in the heart of Southeast Asia, and a very clean and efficient environment.

Successful PhD applicants will work on new research initiatives in the domains of the Lab (3D geospatial data, urban analytics, and GIScience) as part of existing or upcoming projects, and will have a chance to produce high-impact research.
Working at our Lab presents a rare opportunity in Singapore and Southeast Asia to be involved in the entire 3D GIS ecosystem under the same roof: from standardisation and generation of 3D city models all the way to their utilisation and visualisation, while continuously exploring new frontiers in the field. 

We provide a motivating, conducive, and flexible environment to explore the candidate's interests, build relevant skills, and develop world-class research required to attain a PhD degree.
Our conducive and collaborative setting enables you to integrate your project with existing projects and leverage on our network and other activities to turbocharge your research.

Our Lab is located at SDE4, [the first newly-built net-zero energy building in Singapore]({{< ref "/post/2020-12-sde4-ilfi/index.md" >}}), and the first university building in the world to be [WELL Certified Gold](https://www.wellcertified.com/).

Our [department](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/) is consistently [ranked among the best in the world]({{< ref "/post/2021-03-qs-ranking/index.md" >}}).

### Contacting us

Before you contact us, do familiarise yourself with our group.
Our webpage is sufficiently comprehensive (e.g. it has a blog and our publications, which are all available open access) to become acquainted with our work and research agenda, and decide whether it is compatible with your interests and aspirations.

While we appreciate interest, we do not respond to generic applications and those without a clear motivation and understanding of the scope of our work.
Also, your application should demonstrate your research affinity.
We are more likely to reply and support prospective candidates who did a bit of research on what we do and those that are able to demonstrate their aptitude for research and motivate their wish to join us in particular.
This is most evident from a tailored and research-focused application pertaining to our Lab (more about that in the next paragraph).

When contacting us, please send us your CV (in particular, highlight your computational and research skills), accompanied by:
* a brief research proposal containing a summary of the topics that you find interesting and a short literature review that covers recent developments in your area of interest. You should be able to briefly formulate existing gaps and think about how do you plan to fill them. This does not have to be comprehensive and advanced, as during the first months of your PhD you'll have a plenty of time to work on that, but you should be able to demonstrate your motivation and research skills;
* summary of prior research outputs (code, papers, data, internships, thesis, etc. preferably with evidence such as developed GitHub repositories and a personal website);
* a short review of one of our [publications](/publication) with brief ideas how would you take these results further and/or how would you use them for your research; and
* a brief statement how do you envision contributing to our research group. A PhD is a substantial commitment from both sides for a few years, thus, your fit is no less important than your research finesse.

Most of these documents will be required later for the official application to the graduate programme, so you will be able to re-use your effort for it.
Preparing such documentation is quite beneficial as it will also help you explore and refine your thoughts and interests.

Further, make sure that you send your materials in PDF.
Sending Word documents is not only bad practice, but it also implies a lack of computer literacy, which is not viewed favourably.

Finally, if your email goes unattended, please do not send us reminders.
If you did not receive a response, there may be a reason for that, and it is unlikely that you will get one after a reminder.
We receive a large volume of emails, and we are only able to focus on prospective candidates who demonstrate their interest and that they are most likely to succeed in their PhD journey.
We thank you for your interest and understanding.

### Application to NUS and more information

The [NUS website on graduate admissions](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/graduate) is a good starting point to get more information about doing a PhD at our university.
The application deadlines are usually 15 November for the intake in August next year, and 15 May for the start in January.
Please start preparing early, and indicate in your application that you would like to be supervised by Dr {{< mention "filip" >}}.

You may also want to read the graduate studies website of either the [Department of Architecture](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/higher-degrees-by-research/) (and its [FAQ](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/higher-degrees-by-research/frequently-asked-questions/)), or the [Department of Real Estate](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/real-estate/phd/curriculum/) (we are part of both).

### After applying

Do note that we are not involved in the application process nor in admission decisions.
Therefore, we do not have an insight in your application status.
However, you are welcome to get in touch with us about other matters.

### Funding

While the current reality of academia is that obtaining longterm and full scholarships for a PhD is unfortunately often difficult and highly competitive, securing funding is not impossible.
Some of our members and others at our department have been successful in obtaining it.
There are [scholarship opportunities](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/scholarships/) to partially or fully fund your PhD journey, and there are external funding options as well.
There are also [financial aid schemes](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/financial-aid/).
Do also check the [comprehensive list](../fellowships) that we prepared for candidates seeking external funding.
For example, if applicable to you, check out the [The Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net) for a potential scholarship opportunity.
Please note that most external scholarship programmes require a candidate to be admitted to a PhD programme before applying for funding (e.g. providing the letter of acceptance from the university).
Thus, we recommend starting as soon as possible.
If there is a match, we'll be happy to endorse your application.

Good luck!
