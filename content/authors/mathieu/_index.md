I am pursuing a master’s degree in Urban Planning at the NUS College of Design and Engineering.
I hold Bachelor (B.A.) in Political Science from the University of Mannheim in Germany.
I have research experience in the understanding of social movements in urban contexts and their translation in and from social media platforms.
My research interest is on the relationship between the built environment and uprising and protests.
At the UAL, I am working on temporal evolution of built environment data.
