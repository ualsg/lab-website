I am an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore since 2019, and leading the NUS Urban Analytics Lab.
I hold a PhD degree (top 5%) in 3D GIS from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, where I also did my MSc in Geomatics.
As secondary activities, I am an academic editor for GIS in the journal PLOS ONE, and I am involved in the World Economic Forum as council fellow on cities and urbanization.
