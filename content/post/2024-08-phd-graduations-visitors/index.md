In the past few years we hosted several visiting scholars from foreign universities at our research group in Singapore, resulting in many awesome collaborations and projects.

Recently, 9 of them have finished their PhD degrees around the world, obtaining doctoral degrees from universities in mainland China, USA, Denmark, Netherlands, France, and Hong Kong. 🇨🇳🇺🇸🇩🇰🇳🇱🇫🇷🇭🇰

They are featured below.

Congratulations!
It has been a pleasure to have them in our research group and follow their successes and subsequent work.
We are very proud of their accomplishments, thank them for their collaboration (which we hope to continue), and wish them the best in the continuation of their careers.

We continuously welcome visiting scholars.
If you are looking into such a visit, please read our [Guide for prospective applicants](/opportunities/application-guide/).
