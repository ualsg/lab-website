We are a new research group at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) focused on the nexus of 3D geoinformation, urban analytics, and geospatial data science.
Working at our Lab presents a rare opportunity to be involved in the entire 3D GIS ecosystem - from the standardisation and generation of 3D city models to the utilisation and visualisation of these models - in Singapore and Southeast Asia. You would also have the opportunity to continuously explore new frontiers in the geospatial field. 

Our [department](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/arch/) is consistently [ranked among the best in the world]({{< ref "/post/2021-03-qs-ranking/index.md" >}}).

Working at NUS means being part of a leading global university centred in Asia (the #1 university in Asia and world's #11 according to QS 2021) with connections to an extensive network of experts across interdisciplinary domains.
Beyond the university, our network and collaborations span scores of researchers around the world working on a variety of topics.
Our Lab is located at SDE4, [the first newly-built net-zero energy building in Singapore]({{< ref "/post/2020-12-sde4-ilfi/index.md" >}}), and the first university building in the world to be [WELL Certified Gold](https://www.wellcertified.com/).

Singapore is a cosmopolitan English-speaking city-state bridging the East and the West.
It is considered as the [#1 most competitive country](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-economy-ranked-worlds-most-competitive), the [best place to be during the ongoing pandemic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56939261.amp), and the [safest country in the world](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/singapore-ranked-safest-country-world-above-japan-survey). Singapore offers world-class living standards and a very clean, efficient, and low-tax environment which has [successfully attracted talents from all over the world](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-retains-top-spot-in-asia-pacific-index-for-talent-competitiveness).

And of course, it has great food and weather.
