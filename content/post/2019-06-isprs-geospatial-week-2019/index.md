The [ISPRS Geospatial Week 2019](https://www.gsw2019.org) was held in Enschede, the Netherlands.
As part of the [ISPRS WG IV/10 (Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions)](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg10.html), we have been involved in the organisation of the [ISPRS Workshop on Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions (SmartGeoApps 2019)](https://www.gsw2019.org/smartgeoapps/).

The papers have been published in the [ISPRS Annals](https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W5/index.html) and the [ISPRS Archives](https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-2-W13/index.html) (our prefaces can be found [here]({{< ref "/publication/2019-gsw-preface-smartgeoapps-annals/index.md" >}}) and [here]({{< ref "/publication/2019-gsw-preface-smartgeoapps-arch/index.md" >}})).

We also published a collaborative [paper]({{< ref "/publication/2019-gsw-geobim-benchmark/index.md" >}}) during the conference, about the preliminary results of the [GeoBIM benchmark](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/).
