### Job and project description

The [Urban Analytics Lab](/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) is seeking a postdoctoral research fellow to join our research group to spearhead research on 3D city models / BIM, data integration (focusing on crowdsourced and dynamic geospatial data) and use cases, under the umbrella and context of digital twins.
This position is part of a large project, spanning multiple scales: human, building, transportation, and urban scale.

The successful applicant will be engaged on new research lines in digital twins, namely: integration of new data sources, initiating new means of benchmarking and quality assessment of data and workflows, and developing new use cases pertaining to building/urban/geospatial data infrastructure in the context of smart cities.
The nature of the work is computational and practical, and it will include implementing tools, drafting standards, and producing data.

Candidates should have a computational affinity and a PhD degree in computer science, geographical information science, geomatics, or another relevant field of study, with a demonstrated track record (in terms of publications/impact and/or other forms of output such as development).
The PhD requirement can be waived for exceptional candidates without a PhD degree, such as software developers with a publication track record or those with ample working experience.

The research fellow will be supervised by the principal investigator [Dr Filip Biljecki](/authors/filip/), [NUS School of Design and Environment](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

The Lab will provide a motivating, conducive, and flexible environment to explore the research fellow's interests and build skills required for future career steps.

*Our research group aims to increase the share of women in research.
Female candidates are therefore encouraged to apply.*

- An ability to conduct research independently.
- A publication record with demonstrated impact, writing skills, and a strong affinity to publish.
- Proficiency in one of the following areas: GIS, game engines, Geomatics, 3D city modelling, computer science, urban planning, and/or urban simulations.
- Good communication skills in English, and an ability to present research in both academic and non-academic venues.
- Experience with programming. Having built software used by others and/or scientific software experience is a plus.
- An ability to supervise others (e.g. students).
- Curiosity and passion to explore new concepts, methods and technologies, and capability of identifying and quickly learning the most suitable tools for the research on the go.
- A positive and proactive stance on open science, preferably with demonstrated activities such as using and developing open-source software, releasing data as open data, and promoting reproducible research.

### Our offer

- You will be working on compelling research activities at the forefront of geographical information science and urban data science in a new research group that is gaining a strong momentum in Singapore and overseas.
- You will advance your research and transferable skills required for the next stage of your career.
- You will work in a research and educational environment where you may not only contribute to your own development, but also to others, e.g. by supervising master theses that may arise as part of the research.
