The Lab is participating at the [7th Smart Data Smart Cities & 17th 3D GeoInfo
Joint International Conference](https://www.sdsc3dgeoinfo.unsw.edu.au) held in Sydney, Australia.
It is organised by The University of New South Wales (UNSW).

Several members of our research group -- {{% mention "leon" %}}, {{% mention "marcel" %}}, {{% mention "chen-shuting" %}}, {{% mention "yoong-shin" %}}, {{% mention "kay" %}}, {{% mention "yujun" %}}, {{% mention "xiucheng" %}}, {{% mention "tianhong" %}}, and {{% mention "filip" %}} --- have contributed to four (open access) papers published in the conference proceedings:

For some of them, this is their first paper, congrats! :raised_hands: :clap:
