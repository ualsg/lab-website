[State of the Map (SOTM)](https://stateofthemap.org) is the yearly summit of the [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org) community.
[This year's event](https://2022.stateofthemap.org) is taking place in Florence, Italy and online.
It also includes an academic track.

We have two key contributions to this year's edition.

{{< mention "pengyuan" >}} is part of the Scientific Committee for the [Academic Track](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/calls/academic/).
It is its fifth edition.
The papers of the academic track are published open access at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/sotm-22/) (make sure you also check [the editorial](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7004791) co-authored by Pengyuan).


{{< mention "shiyue" >}} is giving [a talk](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/sessions/RHF3UX/) on our ongoing research (_Exploring Human Bias and Effects of Training in OSM mapping: A Behavioral Experiment in Singapore_).

Besides the [talks](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/programme/), consider checking out the [posters](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/posters/) as well.

Thanks to the organisers for this wonderful event, and to the [sponsors](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/#sponsors) for supporting it!
