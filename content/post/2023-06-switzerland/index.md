The PI of the Lab, {{< mention "filip" >}}, represented the Lab during a recent research visit at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich related to the project [Semantic Urban Elements](https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/integration-and-strategies/semantic-urban-elements.html) run at the [FCL Global](https://fcl.ethz.ch), [Singapore-ETH Centre](https://sec.ethz.ch).
He was kindly hosted by the [Chair of Computational Social Science](https://coss.ethz.ch/), our partner group in the project.

In addition, he gave guest lectures and participated in a variety of activities to further our network at the following institutes and groups: ETH Zurich -- [Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation](https://ikg.ethz.ch/en/) (kindly organised by the [Chair of Geoinformation Engineering](https://gis.ethz.ch/en/)), University of Zurich -- Department of Geography -- [GIScience Center](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units.html) (kindly organised by the [Geographic Information Visualization and Analysis (GIVA)](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/giva.html)), and the University of Vienna (meeting the group of Prof [Krzysztof Janowicz](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/research/research-overview/neue-professuren-ab-2020/detailansicht-en/artikel/univ-prof-dr-krzysztof-janowicz/)).


Thank you for the insightful and productive discussions, and sharing the inspiring work.
The hospitality is very much appreciated, and we look forward to collaborating.
