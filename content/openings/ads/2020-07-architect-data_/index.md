### Job and project description

The Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA) has initiated the $300 million Walk2Ride programme in the Land Transport Master Plan 2013, to prioritize the building of sheltered walkways where they are most needed and to improve the walking experience for all commuters. LTA has completed 200km of sheltered walkways by 2018, further planned to build additional 150km of covered linkways within a 400-metre radius of MRT stations, and within a 200-metre radius of bus interchanges, LRT stations and selected bus stops with high commuter volumes by 2040.

The NUS-LTA design-research project focuses on innovative design and production process of Covered Linkways in Singapore with the use of 3D Adaptable Long-span Covered Linkways System, in order to achieve cost optimization of the CAPEX and OPEX with improved quality of user experiences. The research outcome is to be the prototyping for innovative next generation commuter & commuter-related infrastructures, which aims to be applied to the rest of Singapore in future. 

The Department of Architecture, School of Design and Environment, National University of Singapore would like to invite applications for the Research Assistant / Research Associate position under the project titled: NUS-LTA Cost and User Experience Optimization for Commuter and Commuter-related Infrastructure. The integrated design research project will be conducted from the following 3 aspects: 1. 3D Module Design-Fabrication Process Optimization, and 2. Lightweight Long-span Self-cleaning Covered Linkways, both of which are then evaluated by 3. Life cycle costing analyses.

The candidate is expected to work together with another RA (position [advertised concurrently](../2020-07-architect-pm/)) as a team under the supervision of the PI and Co-PI of the project.
