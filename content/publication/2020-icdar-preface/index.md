abstract: "The First International Workshop on Intelligence Cross-Data Analytics and Retrieval (ICDAR'20) welcomes any theoretical and practical works on intelligence cross-data analytics and retrieval to bring the smart-sustainable society to human beings. We have witnessed the era of big data where almost any event that happens is recorded and stored either distributedly or centrally. The utmost requirement here is that data came from different sources, and various domains must be harmonically analyzed to get their insights immediately towards giving the ability to be retrieved thoroughly. These emerging requirements lead to the need for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions that address different aspects of the problem, such as data collection, storage, protection, processing, and transmission, as well as knowledge discovery, retrieval, and security and privacy. Hence, the goal of the workshop is to attract researchers and experts in the areas of multimedia information retrieval, machine learning, AI, data science, event-based processing and analysis, multimodal multimedia content analysis, lifelog data analysis, urban computing, environmental science, atmospheric science, and security and privacy to tackle the issues as mentioned earlier."
