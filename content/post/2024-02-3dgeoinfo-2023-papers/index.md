The [18th International 3D GeoInfo Conference 2023](https://www.3dgeoinfo.org/3dgeoinfo/) took place in Munich, Germany on 13-14 September 2023.
It was hosted by the [Chair of Geoinformatics at the Technical University of Munich](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/gis/home/) led by [Professor Thomas H. Kolbe](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/gis/our-team/staff/prof-thomas-h-kolbe/).
We have [a blog post]({{< relref "/post/2023-09-3d-geoinfo-munich" >}}) about it.

Now the papers from the conference have been published by Springer, as a book _Recent Advances in 3D Geoinformation Science_ (edited by Thomas H. Kolbe, Andreas Donaubauer, Christof Beil), which is part of the series: Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography (LNGC). 
The Proceedings of the 18th 3D GeoInfo Conference, featuring 51 papers, is available [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-43699-4).
We thank the editors for their dedicated work and liaising with the publisher.

Two papers of ours were published and presented at the conference:
