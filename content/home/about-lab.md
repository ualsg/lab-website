We are a new multidisciplinary research group focusing on urban data analysis, geographic data science, and 3D city modelling at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg).
Our mission is to leverage spatially enabled data for urban applications, catalyse the development of spatial data infrastructures in the context of smart cities, and make sense of big geospatial data and digital twins in the built environment.

The research group is led by Dr {{% mention "filip" %}}, [NUS School of Design and Environment](https://www.sde.nus.edu.sg).

We are involved in several international collaborations such as the [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)](https://www.isprs.org) and the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.opengeospatial.org).
Within NUS, we collaborate primarily with two sibling labs: the [Building and Urban Data Science (BUDS) Lab](https://www.budslab.org) and the [Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) Lab](https://ideaslab.io), forming a constellation of research groups with complementary activities and scales.

The full list of our interests and key words: Geographical Information Science (GIS), geospatial machine learning, geographic data science, spatial data infrastructure (SDI), 3D city modelling / 3D GIS / digital twins, 3D urban analytics, spatial data quality and standardisation (CityJSON, CityGML), Volunteered geoinformation (VGI) and OpenStreetMap (OSM), Building Information modelling (BIM) 3D underground data modelling, and 3D cadastre.
