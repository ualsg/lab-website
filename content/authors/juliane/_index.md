Juliane finished her Bachelor in Geomatics (Surveying and Geoinformatics) at the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (Germany) in July 2021 and will start her Master program in Geodesy at the TU Dresden in October 2021.
Currently she is an intern at the NUS for 8 weeks through the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service).
She will mainly work with open geodata, e.g. lidar data, from Dresden and will look at the influence of the accuracy of the source data on errors that occur during analyses.
