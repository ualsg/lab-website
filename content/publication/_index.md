These are our publications since the Lab was established in 2019 (earlier publications of the PI of the lab [Dr Filip Biljecki](/authors/filip/) are available [here](https://filipbiljecki.com/#publications)).
We strive to publish our papers open access when possible.
The PDFs available here are either published as [gold or green open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Colour_naming_system) (usually postprints).
For the authoritative publication please visit the publisher's website linked through the DOI of the article.
For code and data check our [Github page](https://github.com/ualsg) or follow the links noted in the publications.

Please note that this list does not include preprints, but frequently we post them on arXiv, so feel free to [check there](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Biljecki&searchtype=author&source=header) for our latest work that is not yet published in journals or conferences.
